I would like to talk about the role of the imagination in mystical vision. But before I do, I would like to express my gratitude to an amazing Kabbalist by the name of Elliot Wolfson. Much of the material of my talk, and its inspiration come from his book, _The Speculum that Shines: Vision and Imagination in Medieval Jewish Mysticism_. A journey guided by Elliot Wolfson is indeed one in which unimaginable riches are there for the worthy.

## The Ontology of Light

In order to do this, I want to follow Elliot's trail, and start with an exploration into light, which has always been an intrinsic element used in the description of the mystical experience. But firstly, to investigate the ontology of light.

Before continuing, ontology means the investigation of the reality of something. Looking at it from the question of what light really is - both physically and metaphorically, deepens the possibilities inherent in that question. This is a brief excursion into that arena.

So, what is light, and why is it used so often to describe experiences that are, in all probability, not "real", but in, what we assume, is some imaginary realm of perception?
