```
שׁמִר רגליך כאשׁר תלך אל־בית האלוהים, וקרוב לשׁמיע מִתֶת
```

> "Be not overeager to go to the house of G-d.
> "Keep (guard) שׂמור רגליך your foot when walking (going) to the temple"

## Temple

Temple: House of G-d; place of meeting with G-d -> visionary world of the Divine; angelic space.

Place of meeting between G-d & man: In a sense, the temple should then be called, "The Temple of Meeting", just as the Tent was referred to in the Desert. {Or does this become part of the "Only Moses can meet directly with G-d?" line?

## Humble

Underneath does not necessarily mean lower. To acknowledge that you are below (be low = humble). Which means that you acknowledge that you are below (or under-neath) some One. Thus you have the "lower realm", which is not really "lower", but rather "further". 'Further from what', you may ask. Further from the Truth (or Light of the Truth, or the True Light). To acknowledge myself as humble (לְהִתַחת)

## Joy

> ואין השׁכינה שׁורה אלא מתוך שׂמחה

"The Divine Presence (_Shekhina_) abides only in joy" (_Shabbat 30b_)

## Ability to Receive (from 1)

In Hebrew, _Hashem_ is not even the second word. In fact, it is the third and the sentence is rendered sometime like: "It will be seen/appeared to..." I emphasise this, because the first step is one of looking, then seeing. In order for it to appear, one must have looked at it, and the in order to "see" it, something (hopefully what you were looking for) must have been "found"... and that requires a stillness, and ability to receive.

## 1, 2, 3...

- One: is G-d
- Two: is Creation
- Three: is Life
- Four: Completion & Beginning
- Five: Foundation
- Six: Consciousness
- Seven: Fruiting
- Eight: Recurring, continuing
- Nine: Death
- One & Zero: Next Level

## Stand Over/Stand Under

```
יותר מִשֶׁהאישׁ רוצה לִשֹׂא, אישׁה רוצה להנשׂא
```

- Note that here the word ניצב ־ ניצבים is used for standing over him. Whereas in verse 8, the more common word אומד is used when Abraham, the man, is "stands over" the angels.
- Why are angels traditionally represented as male?
