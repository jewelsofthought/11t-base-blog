## Systems (old)

All dynamic/moving systems are alive. If a system never changes, then it is dead. If a food can stand open for a long time, then it is dead. All static, absolute, unmoving systems are dead. Thus sterilized systems or pasteurised food stuffs are often life depleting. Though there is must support and nourishment that a dead tree or animal provides the living creature of the forest.

## Sovereignty ~ empowerment

> There is no real sovereignty. The only real sovereign is G-d. The only earthly sovereignty we experience, is as power over. What we can seek only in the societal environment, is "empowerment".## Law

> Because there is no law forbidding something, does not mean it is acceptable to do it.

## Bridging

If an addict wishes to change and escape the chains of his addiction, he needs a safe alternative, before he crashes. If there is a bridge available that provided a way out of his present situation, and into something safe, many would choose the this option - especially in the current global crisis.

### Between two worlds

Just as the healer tries to guide the addict out of his darkness into another world, a world that is filled with more light for him especially. Similarly, the mystic tries to lead people, who are unhappy and unfulfilled, to a path that will increase their joy and light.

## Power & Governance

> Where power goes, governance must follow.

## Governance in the global space.

The challenge is to bring governance into the global space.

Humanity is rediscovering its commons: the self-organized management of resources which people need for their survival and livelihood. The ethic of commoning is based on the recognition that a person has the right to a means of sustenance without interference or harm from others. In this sense, the commons are an inclusive expression of the right to life and the right to justice.

Our greatest challenge is not the risk of environmental collapse, resource wars, scarcity diaspora's, oppressive rulers or rancorous disputes over why future generations are denied the opportunity to live in a peaceful and equitable society. Our true task is the creation of inclusionary institutions for sustainable resource production and provisioning as the climate crisis bears down upon the world.

## 666m (cov-19)

But the descent from 7B to 666m will be catastrophic and will be a stranger to any who dreamt of a world with only 666m people inhabiting it.

## Fish

Like a school of fish, all travelling in the same direction. But what position any particular fish takes, or when or why is unclear.

- Highly complex and time consuming to reconstruct.
- Use "wave dynamics to cause it to flow over like a wave
  - Amplitude, speed, frequencey, phase angle...
- How many variables?
  - Indexer does not have to calculate.
  - It just keeps the waves flowing
- Source
  - When the wave leaves its source, each element reacts according to its state.
  - The next one will know it and reject and begin reset.
  - Traverses as far as it needs
    or exits with error.
