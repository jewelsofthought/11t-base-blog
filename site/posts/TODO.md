## 3. Sustainable

As in communities that self-sufficient, and are able to robust and dynamic

- What does sustainable really mean
- Is it a viable concept?
- Is perhaps a better paradigm that of [mutually beneficial co-dependance (MBCo)](codependent.html)?

## 5. Waves

Any wave can be represented in any wave form.

## 6. New energy

What is the energy/energies of the future?

## 9. Systems

### Complex Systems

[Reproduction:]Takes a certain amount of iterations (generally, at least, 4) in order for the "complexity" (actually regularity) to appear. [Regulating:] At which point it becomes "self-regulating/governing". It manifests order/pattern - but the pattern is unpredictable.

## 11. Freedom

- Freedom from... what?

  - Freedom from oppression
  - Freedom from bondage
  - Freedom from tyrants
  - Freedom from liars
  - Freedom from psychopathic leadership

- Freedom for... what?
  Most of the time, we want freedom to do, or explore, the things we are not allowed or permitted to explore. The great adventure is escaping from your confinement and venturing out into the wilderness to experience something greater.
  And there are those of us who are terrified of what lurks in the darkness beyond which we can see.
  A balance between both is what we seek.

  Again, I ask, Freedom for... what?
  Often we escape from one bondage, only to find ourselves caged in another. Can we ever escape that bondage, even if it is only to our own petty or grandiose desires?

  - Egotism: The lowest form of freedom, is freedom to do what I want. To have what I want. Completely ego driven is very attractive to many who doubt their own worth, but is in the end so lonely, that it drives many to madness or to suicide. For, if successful, their whole existence will eventually consist only of reflections of their own egos \- nothing else will be able to live in their space, and its surrounds. If unsuccessful, they will be absorbed into their own fantasies, and could sink into some deep dark place, from which any wierd energy could explode.
  - Altruism: The next, normal humane level is that of service to an-other, or in a more developed form, others. Pure altruism, to dedicate oneself totally to the needs of other, is noble, but can be draining on the soul. There must be something left for yourself, otherwise you will dissolve in the ocean of needy. Take care, that it does not become a need, and thus essentially ego-feeding, instead of ego-reducing.
  - Seers: The we have the madmen and women who are driven by some vision that they see, or hear, or feel. They are a mixture of pure egotist, and yet often they are not driven by the gains of what they seek.

## 12. Energy as Currency

They are welcome to participate in our exchange system as well. It is based purely on energy exchange. It has two forms. The first is that of "energy at rest", and it has a certain "measure". The other is "energy at work" or force and it has a similar measure. Though these can be described with a number of other comparitive variables as well - which we will not go into yet. [Think of volts, amps & ohms and their relationship; as well as watts, coulumbs & joules]

## 14. Decentralised system

It aims for a decentralised system that actively forcuses on NOT preventing the less-fortunate people's access to the resources that they need to live decent lives. To have support and encouragement would be superb. However, I think the need for control is what requires those in power to strictly regulate ALL access to resources - ultimate power being the control of all access to every resource The network solution to that is, being powered by and from community groups their communal needs, not by obeying the commands of a centralised system with an overarching authority â€“ which is the kind of hierarchical control systems we have at present.
